# Hiired Full Stack Practical Assessment
Thank you for taking the time to participate in the Hiired Practical Assessment.

## Requirements
We recommend that you use node, express and either mongodb or postgresql to build several RESTful API endpoints using POST, PUT, DELETE and GET requests.

For the front end, we recommend using a frontend framework such as Vue, React or Angular along with bulma, bootstrap or pure.css for basic component styling.

The app will provide the following functionality:
 - populate chosen database with provided data
 - create new user
 - update user
 - delete user
 - get all users
 - get user by id
 - filter/search users created between a time range
 - search users by first name or last name
 - order results by first_name, last_name, created_at, updated_at

 ## How it is reviewed
 - *Does it work?*: i.e. does your README describe the pre-requisites and steps in order to get your solution running?
 - *Quality* over completeness. Is it easy to understand and maintainable? Have you used a code styling guide?
 - *Best Practices*: have you separated concerns? how clean is the separation between front-end and back-end?
 - *Technical Trade-offs*: did you have to make any technical trade-offs?
 - *Security*: are there any obvious vulnerabilities?
 - *Testing*: have you made practical choices on necessary unit and integration tests? are your tests atomic?
 - *UX*: is the site easy to navigate and is the API intuitive?

 ## Bonus
 - *Production*: does it have logging? have you used error handling? have you integrated swagger for the API documentation?
 - *DevOps*: have you published the solution? have you written a docker compose file for deployment?

 ## Submissions
 Please submit via a public github repository.
